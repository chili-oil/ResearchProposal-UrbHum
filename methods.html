    <h3>Methods and Design</h3>
    <div class="background-container">
      <p>
        The general methodology that I would use would be a qualitative case study involving people of various ages from the OCD and ADHD communities. This method would work best as it pairs well with medical research. The case study method has been used before by (Pike et al., 2021) for older adults who have a dementia diagnosis and their interactions with robotic pets. This method worked well because Pike’s research team treated each case as individual and compared the results from each person participating. This allows medical staff to take note of medical benefits/concerns, and for family members/friends to give input on social benefits/concerns as well. Participants would be people who have a ADHD or a OCD diagnosis. Participants should represent groups from different age ranges (5-10,11-18,19-29,30-50,51-70,71+). Participants that are not currently invited are ones that do not identify as members of the above groups (diagnosed with ADHD or OCD).<br><br>

The variations/manipulations that I would include would be:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Choosing to involve individuals who have a OCD or ADHD diagnosis.</li>
          <li>Choosing to have the individuals come to the study area and speaking with a trained nurse for 4 weeks (4 sessions) for 1 hour. This would be a part-time experience with the robotic pet.</li>
          <li>The next 4 weeks would be a full-time experience with the robotic pet based in the individual's home where they can document their own experience through text, video, images, or audio. </li>
          <li>Age of the participants will be noted. In the case of the dementia participants, age was not recorded.</li>
          <li>An initial session to introduce the participant to the robotic pet, teach the participant on how the robotic pet functions, and to gather information from the participant, and the participant’s consent.</li>
          <li>Dementia participants were asked to volunteer through an ad in a newspaper. In this study, research participant inquiries will be placed on flyers of ADHD and OCD support groups, subreddit threads, and through virtual support groups as well.</li>
        </ul><br>
Making these manipulations would allow for the participant to document their own first hand experiences, and to have the participant involved in the research process in an active role (versus a passive role where the participant is being observed only). The participants' feedback will give greater insight into their emotional and social wellbeing. If the participant is witnessing and describing benefits, this can help support the hypothesis. If the participant is only witnessing a neutral or negative experience, then the hypothesis is not supported.<br><br>

Factors needing to be controlled would be the robotic pet. The choice of robotic pet would be chosen by the research team for all participants. Another factor would be controlling the location that participants would meet at for the first four weeks. The third factor would be a range of ages of the participants. The last factor would be making sure that the participants can document their own experiences in an active manner.<br><br>

An issue that could arise is if the participants do not have friends and family that we can speak to about experiences that they notice of the participants. Another possibility is that participants give false feedback on their experiences. For example, stating a positive experience when they are experiencing the opposite. To help mitigate the claiming of false information, the participants would need to involve their family or friends as a witness.<br><br>

The robotic pet will be initially introduced to the participant at a control location for a 1 hour appointment each week for 4 weeks. A trained nurse will help to teach the participant on the functions of the robotic pet and allow for the participant to explore using the robotic pet. After this 4 week period, the participant will bring the robotic pet to their home for 4 weeks. Participants should make a daily recording of their own experience - through video, photo, text, or audio recording. After these 4 weeks, the participant will meet with a trained nurse to share their experience and closing thoughts. The robotic pets will be returned to the research team unless a negative outcome would result, in which case the participant will keep the robotic pet.<br><br>

Results will be coded and organized by experience, emotion, outcome, positive/negative effect, and statements made by individuals. These codes will be further grouped by age range and graphed to better understand if the hypothesis is supported. Results will support the hypothesis if more than 50% of participants report positive benefits (social, mood, communication, etc.). If  50% or less of participants report positive benefits then the hypothesis will not be supported.

    <h1>Robotic Pets</h1>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Outcomes for people with dementia and robotic pet ownership have been studied primarily. The results from these studies show that there are positive benefits: “Positive impacts included improved mood and affect, communication, social interaction, and companionship; these benefits resonate with findings in reviews that investigated the effectiveness of other social robots and robotic pets for older adults and people with dementia…” (Koh et al., 2021). The hope is to look into other demographics as the following focus on those who have dementia and older adults: (Martens & Hildebrand, 2021), (Pike et al., 2021), (Hudson et al., 2020), and (Van Orden et al., 2022). The main robotic pets used in these studies were <a href="https://joyforall.com/">Joy for All Companion Pets</a> and <a href="http://www.parorobots.com/">Paro</a> (a robotic seal).<br>Some other studies have looked at the outcomes of children with autism interacting with robotic pets and have found positive results, but these results are unique to each child (and the manner of play that the child enjoys) (François et al., 2009) (Melson et al., 2009). The main robotic pets used in these studies were versions of the <a href="https://us.aibo.com/">Sony Aibo</a> (a robotic dog).<br>These studies are wonderful, but do not address other neurodivergent communities. I would like to look into outcomes associated with robotic pet use for those with ADHD and OCD. Are there any benefits for members of these communities? Is there a model of robotic pet that is most easy to benefit from?

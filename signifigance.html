        This proposed research could help to open up avenues for possible benefits in relation to robotic pets for people with various forms of neurodivergence. This research could also assist in providing insurance coverage for robotic pets if positive outcomes can be documented in a quantitative and qualitative way. People who are experiencing various forms of neurodivergence may not respond well to traditional medications, or may need a supplemental support in addition to their medication/s. If a helpful support can be found without symptoms, this would help improve the lives of people who are neurodivergent without adding additional complications.

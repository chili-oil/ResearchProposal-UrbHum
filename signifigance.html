        This proposed research could help to open up avenues for possible benefits in relation to robotic pets for people with various forms of neurodivergence. This research could also assist in providing insurance coverage for robotic pets if positive outcomes can be documented in a quantitative and qualitative way. In research for those experiencing dementia, there were positive outcomes as documented by (Pike et al., 2021): 
        <ul>
          <li>Encouragement of communication</li>
          <li>Calming interactions with the robotic pet when dementia symptoms were causing distress in the person</li>
          <li>People who were withdrawn were more present</li>
        </ul>
People who are experiencing various forms of neurodivergence may not respond well to traditional medications, or may need a supplemental support in addition to their medication/s. My hope is that robotic pets may prove to show similar results in people with a OCD or ADHD diagnosis. If a helpful support can be found without symptoms, this would help improve the lives of people who are neurodivergent without adding additional complications.

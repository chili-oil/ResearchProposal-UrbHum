    <div class="background-container">
      <p>
      <em>Questions being researched</em>: Are there any benefits for members of the ADHD and OCD communities? Is there a model of robotic pet that is most easy to benefit from?<br><br>
These questions will help me address finding alternative solutions for people who may be experiencing increased neurological symptoms during quarantine, but feel that they may not be able to care for a living pet. My hypothesis, based on the other studies listed above, is that people who are members of the ADHD and OCD communities will find positive benefits in playing with, and being in the company of a robotic pet. My hope is that these findings can then be used as evidence to help neurodivergent communities to gain insurance coverage in purchasing robotic pets. If my hypothesis is supported, it may be beneficial to look into other neurodivergent communities and their outcomes with robotic pets. If my hypothesis is not supported, then other accessible modes of assistance should be looked into for people with ADHD and OCD.
